Win Guide is a continuation of the ["The Guide" v 2.0](http://theguide.sourceforge.net/) project in MFC. It's a hierarchical (rich) text editing application that allows you to create/edit document trees (and of-course also documents within those trees). It is an excellent way of organizing your notes, to-do lists, work logs, project ideas, blog content, book chapters/sub chapters etc.

The original author has declared that he will not be working on this program any more and a couple of other developers will be redeveloping this excellent application in QT. But as you may have already guessed this will take a significant amount of time. I have decided that I cannot live without the following features any more hence I will implement them myself using the old code base (v 2.0).

**Features planned for Win guide v2.1**
  * Commands / shortcuts
    * Inc/Dec font size (Ctrl + `[`; Ctrl + `]`)
    * Format painter (Ctrl + Shift + C; Ctrl+Shift+V )
    * Remove formatting (Ctrl+Space)

  * Support for reconfigurable shortcuts
  * Adjustable tab spaces/smart indentation
  * Support for code blocks
  * Simple navigation controls (go back, go forward)

**Good to have features**
  * Support for reconfigurable toolbars
  * Support for simple tables
  * Support for simple drawings
  * Sync with web
